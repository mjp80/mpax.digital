[https://mpax.digital](mpax.digital) is my personal homepage.  Probably going to turn into abandonware in time.

## Installation

You need node/npm (I used version 12.6.1 of Node)
You also need a Contentful account, as I write GraphQL queries against the content model - so it'll not work out of the box.  Not that anyone will download / run this anyhow.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run develop
```
