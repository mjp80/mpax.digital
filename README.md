Progression from MVP static site to (probably) abandonware

URL: https://mpax.digital

Dependencies
------------

- Node JS (I was using 12.6.1)
- html-minifier (to minify the source HTML)
- http-server (to serve the static site on a local dev account)

This deploys to Netlify.  You'll need to set an appropriate token up for your own purposes.


To get started
--------------

npm install
npm run dev
