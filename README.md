Progression from MVP static site to (probably) abandonware

URL: https://mpax.digital

Dependencies
------------

- Node JS (I was using 12.6.1)
- html-minifier (to minify the source HTML)
- http-server (to serve the static site on a local dev account)

This site deploys to a Netlify account.  You'll need to set an appropriate API access token up and store it in your ENV vars.


To get started
--------------
Checkout and then 

    npm install && npm run dev
