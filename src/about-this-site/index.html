            <h2>About this site</h2>
        </hgroup>
        <p>As your career progresses, you tend to drop out of the real work and migrate towards higher level, more
            managerial activities.</p>
        <p>That has certainly happened in my case, so I wanted to revisit coding by creating the lowest common
            denominator MVP of a website and then undertake a journey of modernising it and documenting the journey.</p>
        <h3>Latest updates</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span><time datetime="2020-07-15">15/07/2020</time> - CSS split</span>
                <p>Simple update today.  CSS is now loaded from a separate stylesheet.  Best practice says I should probably inline it as well, but that's for another day.  Lighthouse still at 100, thankfully!</p>
                <p>Next is to add some more design elements to make it more appealing.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span><time datetime="2020-07-14">14/07/2020</time> - Build pipeline</span>
                <p>The site now has the barebones of a modern dev & deployment pipeline set up.  I used <code>npm</code> to do it.  We have a static HTTP server now serving the dev site through <code>http-server</code>, and code is automatically minified via <code>html-minifier</code> and deployed via <a target="_blank" href="//netlify.com" rel="noopener">Netlify's</a> excellent CLI/API.</p>
                <p>I'll probably split the CSS next, as it's becoming a pain to update both pages separately and inline it.  Hopefully my 100% Lighthouse scores won't fall.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span><time datetime="2020-07-13">13/07/2020</time> - Site launch</span>
                <p>First iteration is a couple of hardcoded HTML pages with inlined CSS and no JS. Minified manually
                    using an online tool and copied up to Netlify.</p>
                <p>It should score 100 across the board on Lighthouse, be (almost) WCAG-AAA accessible and pass a
                    penetration test with a top grade.</p>
                <p>It's already becoming evident after 2 pages that I need to put together a simple build and deployment
                    pipeline and look at a lightweight CMS to manage content. So that'll be the next job.
